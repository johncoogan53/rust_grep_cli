# Rust CLI for grep
Rust implemented Globally Search a Regular Expression and Print (GREP) CLI. This is a project used to get more familiar with the rust language. It is also an opportunity to set up a robust template for Makefile + workflows to make a CI/CD pipeline. 

Key features:

- Well structured Rust project with main binary and library crate with associated tests. 
- Template CI/CD with jobs for Check, Format, Lint, and Release with a binary artifact generated at the end.

Working directory can be changed in the yml file to generate build scripts for multiple binaries with ease.
